Also, you can follow influencers and shop online within the RED app.

However, if you are using the RED’s website, you can have a quick browse of a few selected posts, but it is limited to 1 page, if you wish to browse or search more, you need to download the app. You can browse a post without creating an account only if when an existing users share the post as a link to you.

## Social Media and your PLN in Education

### How do people interact on RED?
RED is a platform for people to share and record their lives. The blog is based on their experiences and daily life. Visitors could double click on the images to express their liking of the content or leave comments in the comment section. Most of the creators love to reply to the comments and discuss.!

### How do educators use the platform?
An example of a music instructor
He Juan is a vocal instructor. She usually posts her content as a video. It is more convenient for her to show how to pronounce words and how to breathe properly. Since she teaches the pronunciation of each word, her audience is more suitable for beginners. The comment section is dominated by compliments or anticipation of her next instructional video content that is to her liking.

### Posts and feedback
When we posted a note about a statistics class, one third of the reviewers were interested in the helpful post, such as which textbook the note was from or asking questions about the ununderstood part of the problem solving process. The rest of them say thank you. We also did a post about restaurants in Vancouver. Comments on this type of post fall into three categories. One is to collect our posts; the second is the affirmation and love of people who have been to the restaurant; the third is their dissatisfaction and complaint based on the experience they once visited, but the third group is in the minority. In Red, the chances of a post being picked up are driven by likes and location. So most people respond differently to similar types of posts. What they respond to depends on the content of the post. If it's the same post, they may not respond to the same post twice. Because of this mode, the way they reply is not based on a Persona of account.

### Concerns that educators should be aware of regarding RED
As for my platform, educators should pay attention to copyright issues. As my answer to the last question, we can find many similar posts, such posts may be by some public accounts to transfer other people's work for profit. It's so common that visitors don't really care who the original post is. Unless our account is one with a lot of followers, that might be a bit of a deterrent.

### Things we notice that a curious educator might want to know about RED
Because our platform is a kind of sharing platform. Anything you want to know will be posted by a relevant person based on his experience. But one of the most fascinating things about our platform is that different people, different identities and different ages give different summaries. For example, when you want to remember a word, a professional will tell you what the word means. But in Red, there are also non-professionals who may be students or homemakers or whatever, who share their own ways of memorizing words. Learning about different summaries and experimenting with different approaches is perhaps the most attractive aspect of the platform.

## Balancing your PLN and Public Discourse

### How do notable, high-profile individuals use social media?
As we all know, there is not only one person running the account on the social platform of well-known celebrities. Behind each well-known account there is a team, one part is responsible for publicity, one part is responsible for video editing and manuscript editing, one part is responsible for business docking, and the most important one is responsible for the “performance” in front of the screen.

### What are the benefits to being in the public eye and having a PLN?
Celebrities use social platforms for profit and business. By accumulating a certain number of fans to obtain the cooperation opportunities of the brand side.

### Building community with online tools provided by an employer can be limiting, what are some possible restrictions and benefits?

### Delivering information in a connected society requires verifiable resources, how can you ensure that you build a PLN you can rely on?

### How do those who are veteran story tellers minimize the risk of sharing misinformation?
